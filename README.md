In this project, we omit a lot of data from the original source. We also make some small changes:

- Languages and countries are following ISO 639-1 and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, respectively
- Genders are represented by numbers instead of literal word
- The IDs, except for series IDs and real person's (i.e. cast and crew) IDs, are internal to our project and not related to the TVMaze's ids

All these changes are also published under CC-BY-SA 4.0.
